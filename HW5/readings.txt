## I ran the models locally rather than on the server and was bounded by the computation speed. Hence, I ran it for the smaller validation set. It can be replaced with a higher validation set as well. The Tiny YOLO model completed but the YOLO did not. I have the timings for both of them and MAP value for Tiny YOLO. The code is complete and can be executed on the server to display the readings. \
